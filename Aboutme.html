    <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
    <p> I am a Product Marketer who is in the process of learning how to code. As a devoted student to the practice of yoga as well, I seek to shed light upon a path to balance by connecting your day to day prana, movement, self-inquiry and challenge to always continue learning. 

  	This path is an open invitation to create space for possibility; to ride the waves of expansion and contraction; to peer beyond all that which separates, binds, limits or constrains us. This practice is an open invitation to show up completely to lifeâ€™s ebbs and flows with a  wide  open heart.</p>
